####  The game is as follows: the first player presses the "roll dice" button and a number appears. Then, they choose either to keep it immediately or take a chance and press the "roll" button again, or hold onto it using the "hold" button.


##### If they take a chance and roll a 1, they will lose the points they have accumulated in the "current" box 😝.

##### 👑 The winner is the first player to reach 100 points.
